| GIL Impact                     | Affected by GIL                | Not affected by GIL              | Not affected by GIL                |

Note that the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** is a feature of the Python language that prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously. This means that only one thread can execute Python code at a time, which can limit the performance benefits of multithreading in certain scenarios. However, the **GIL** does not affect **multiprocessing** or **asynchronous programming**, which can provide higher levels of parallelism in Python 3.
